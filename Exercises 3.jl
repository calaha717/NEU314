- Takes String image_file, Int pixel_shift, and optional Int

  and moves them to the bottom of the channel. If no channel
  specification is given, defaults to channel 1 (red). Returns
  shifted channel.

PARAMETERS:

- number of pixel rows to shift (Int)
- (optional) channel to be modified (Int), defaults to 1 (red)
